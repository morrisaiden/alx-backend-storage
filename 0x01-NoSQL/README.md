NoSQL databases are a category of database management systems that are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases (SQL databases), NoSQL databases don't rely on a fixed schema or table structures. They are built to scale out and handle big data applications, offering flexibility and efficiency in managing different types of data.

Key Characteristics of NoSQL Databases:
1. Schema-less Data Models:

NoSQL databases do not require a predefined schema. This allows for dynamic insertion of data without altering the schema, making it easier to store and process diverse data types.

2. Horizontal Scalability:

NoSQL databases are designed to scale out by distributing data across multiple servers. This horizontal scaling makes them suitable for handling large-scale data and high traffic loads.

3. Flexible Data Models:

NoSQL databases support various data models, including document, key-value, column-family, and graph models, allowing developers to choose the best model for their application's needs.

4. High Availability and Fault Tolerance:

Many NoSQL databases are designed to be distributed and replicated across multiple nodes, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

5. Eventual Consistency:

In contrast to the strict consistency of relational databases, NoSQL databases often provide eventual consistency. This means that the database may not be immediately consistent across all nodes, but will become consistent over time.
